HTML & CSS
HTML :
HTML is the foundation behind all web pages. It’s used to add structure and form to text, images, and more.

HTML Elements:
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have 
an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).

Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

This example contains four HTML elements:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

Headings
Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

CSS :
is the language used to style HTML content. In this  course, we’ll learn the fundamentals of 
both languages so that you can create visually appealing web pages.
External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
